## Stakeholders
**Stakeholders Frustrations and Pain Points**: 
- **Digital Artists**: Sophie mentioned, “I used to do paintings and have moved more towards digital art now, where there isn’t as much interaction.” It can be observed that there is a lack of community and connection in the digital art world, compared to more traditional forms of art.
- **City Explorers**: Tim mentioned that he would prefer if exploration applications had more access to less touristy areas to really explore the in-depths of the city rather than just the face of the city.  
- **Photographers**: Tim also mentioned that as a photographer and artist, he would find it more motivating to be able to capture unique sights of the city through art. 
- **Graphic Design students**: Yixiao mentioned that although museums offer a good amount of exhibitions of artworks, they are still missing the part of interaction, for example, the openings of the galleries and a space solely for the artist she is interested in. Galleries sometimes fail to provide enough artworks for her to view.

**Stakeholders Goals**: 
1. Create an application with a social aspect that can bring artists together and re-instill a sense of community within the digital art world. A way to do this is to allow users to make and share art. 
2. Create an application to encourage exploration of the city in general and to find new unique and interesting spots throughout the city. 
3. To create a platform to introduce and teach the use of AR technology to people who may not be aware/familiar with its capabilities. 
4. Create an application that encourages non-artists to explore art shared by communities of artists in a non-traditional way - that is, making the city a gallery. 
5. Create an application that makes art more accessible to everyone, disregarding economical, physical, geographical limitations.


## Product Vision Statement
ARtwork is a groundbreaking mobile application that transforms cities into vibrant canvases of creativity and exploration through the magic of augmented reality. Our vision is to empower teenagers and young adults to treat their city as a canvas to design, rediscover their urban environments, fostering a deep connection to their communities and city while unlocking their inner artists.  


## User Requirements
### User story #1: As a digital artist, I want to display my art so I can get some recognition or viewership.

Estimation of effort: Medium

Acceptance criteria:
- Artist’s name is mentioned. 
- There is a hyperlink / QR code to the artist’s related website or their profile.
- Artists should have a profile tab on the app.
- Artists should have the option to put a name, profile picture, and related website on their profile.
- Other users can like artists' works, add comments and even share to other users, essentially like social media. 



### User story #2: As a local of NYC with no art experience, I want to look at and understand AR art while walking around so I can feel more connected to my community in a virtual world. 

Estimation of effort: Hard

Acceptance criteria:
- When clicked on artworks, it will be followed by a description provided by the artist to understand more about the art piece.
- The app provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface for navigating and viewing AR art while walking around the city. 
- Users can add artists they like to the ‘Saved Artists’ section under their profile; they can see more of these artists’ works and get notified when they publish new art.


### User story #3: As a college student in NYC, I want to share the art I see with my friends so that I can have interesting conversations with them.

Estimation of effort: Medium

Acceptance criteria:
- Users should be able to save the art to their personal “Gallery” tab.
- The app allows users to easily share specific pieces or their entire gallery on various social media and messaging platforms. 
- Users can also share profiles of their favorite artists with friends.


### User story #4. As a user of the AR app, I expect to receive approximate location information for artworks rather than precise coordinates. This way, I will need to explore and walk around the city to discover the art, making the experience more interactive and engaging. The app should replicate the exploration aspect of games like Pokemon Go, but with art as the focus.

Estimation of effort: Medium
> Note: Hard if there is an in-app map. 

Acceptance criteria: 
- The app has two modes; Adventure mode and Regular mode. Where regular mode allows the user to find precise locations of artwork, however, adventure mode provides an approximate location for artworks, giving users a general area to explore rather than precise coordinates. 
- Users can use this information to navigate and find art within the city.



### User story #5. As a user interested in adding variety to my daily routine, I want the app to send me notifications encouraging me to step outside and search for artworks. 

Estimation of effort: Medium 

Acceptance criteria: 
- The app sends notifications to users of certain places to visit throughout the city.
- The app also offers the “Explore” tab where users can find new events nearby to their location regarding any artworks throughout the city. 



### User story #6. As a user, I want the ability to replace artworks created by other artists within the app. I expect the app to track these replacements, allowing me to view past artworks that have been swapped, even though I cannot collect them.

Estimation of effort: Hard

Acceptance criteria: 
- Users who are artists and have an AR file (GLB or gITF) can replace artworks created by other artists with their own within the app. 
- The app maintains a tracking system to record these replacements. 
- Users can access a history of past artworks that have been swapped, but they cannot collect them. 


### User story #7. As a user, I want the ability to create private rooms or servers of the city where I can possibly display my own artwork and just for my own view. 

Estimation of effort: Medium

Acceptance Criteria: 
- The app can contain a feature which allows users to join private servers or rooms where they can upload their own art and the only users that can view them is themselves.
- Users have full control over their private rooms and if they wish to share their artwork later and make it public, they can choose to do so.
- If users have made public artworks and would like to make them private, they are also able to do so. 


### User story #8. As a user, I want the ability to restrict myself from viewing certain pieces of artwork, for censorship reasons etc. 

Estimation of effort: Extra Hard

Acceptance Criteria: 
- The app has to decide how to detect what certain pieces of art look like (perhaps through the incorporation of AI/machine learning). 
- Based on what the app detects, it will label certain artworks and filter what can be seen and what can’t be seen depending on the user’s needs. 


### User story #9. As a photographer, I want to be able to take photographs of the city through the app in order to capture everyone’s artwork at once. 

Estimation of effort: Medium

Acceptance Criteria: 
- The app will include an in-app camera feature which will allow the user to capture photos of the city through AR.
- The photos will be automatically saved onto their gallery.



### User story #10. As a user, I wish for the app to include possible art events throughout the city to encourage community building, enhance exploration further and view even more artworks. 

Estimation of effort: Hard

- The app will include an “Explore” tab. 
- Through this section, users will be able to search for events throughout the city that are nearby to their location.
- Users can also host events through the app and send private or public invitations to other users.
